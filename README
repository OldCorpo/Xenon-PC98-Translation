ＸＥＮＯＮ ～夢幻の肢体～
XENON ~The limbs of phantasmagoria~ : Translation project

Advancement :
	Translation : Roughly the 98.5% ~ 100% is translated (but may need style  
                                                 revisions and other things)
				  Refer to the notes/progress_file.txt for info.

	At this point, translation is basically complete in length, next step 
    would be use the tools at from the Tools repo and follow instructions. 
    
    Prior to using the tools in the url below, use scene-merge.sh to 
    merge scene_TLs into a single script-japanese-with-translation.txt,
    and Formatter.bat to create a _script-japanese.txt file that needs 
    to be copied into translation\_script-japanese.txt in the Tools repo.

    Then follow instructions in:
    
    https://github.com/XenonTranslation/tools    

    Unfortunately, after checking there, apparently some of the tools/code 
    are broken, so the options from here are, either fix the issues or 
    otherwise HexEdit the .CC game files with a hex tool like wxMEdit, 
    which unfortunately I don't have the skill to.

    Apparently the issue is at the first step, Merge.

    For additional info check the notes folder, notes/legacy_notes.txt

    - When a line starts with '/*', it means I am not satisfied with
    the translation I used and that it needs rephrasing.
    - Some other things are explained at the beginning of src/Formatter.c
    (the source code of the formatter)

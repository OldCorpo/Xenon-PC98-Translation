ＸＥＮＯＮ ～夢幻の肢体～
XENON ~The limbs of phantasmagoria~ : Translation project

Advancement :
	Translation : Roughly the 98.5% ~ 100% is translated (but may need style  
                                                 revisions and other things)
				  Refer to the progress_file.txt for more info.

	At this point translation is basically complete, next step would be HexEdit
	the .CC game files with a hex tool like wxMEdit, which unfortunately I don't 
	have the skill to.

======

In the translation, I use the following code :

 - When a line starts with '/*', it means I am not satisfied with
 the translation I used and that it needs rephrasing.
 - Some other things are explained at the beginning of src/Formatter.c
 (the source code of the formatter)
 
 The file 'translation-notes.rtf' serves as a notepad for me.
 
 The file 'title_screen_tracy's_melancholy_jap.BMP' shows the title screen of the last ending.
 I don't know how this is stored in the game but, this will have to be translated
 as :
	肉奴隷			Sex slave
	トレイシーの憂鬱	Tracy's melancholy

======

The (mostly complete) scene translations are located in the scene_TLs directory.
They are more or less broken down by scene, but there is some overlap.
Current second pass TL progress: Start of s0106

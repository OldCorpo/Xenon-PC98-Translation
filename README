ＸＥＮＯＮ ～夢幻の肢体～
XENON ~The limbs of phantasmagoria~ : Translation project

Advancement :
	Translation : Roughly the 98.5% ~ 100% is translated (but may need style  
                                                 revisions and other things)
				  Refer to the notes/progress_file.txt for info.

	At this point, translation is basically complete in length, next step 
    would be use the tools at from the Tools repo and follow instructions. 

Usage:

    Use scene-merge.sh to merge scene_TLs into a single 
	script-japanese-with-translation.txt file.

    Use Formatter.bat to create a _script-japanese.txt file.

	The _script-japanese.txt that needs to be copied into 
	translation\_script-japanese.txt in the Tools repo.
   
    Then follow instructions at:

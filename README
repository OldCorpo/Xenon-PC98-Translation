ＸＥＮＯＮ ～夢幻の肢体～
XENON ~The limbs of phantasmagoria~ : Translation project

Advancement :
	Translation : Roughly the 98.5% ~ 100% is translated (but may need style  
                                                 revisions and other things)
				  Refer to the progress_file.txt for more info.

	At this point, translation is basically complete in length, next step 
    would be use the tools at from the Tools repo and follow instructions. 
    
    Prior to using the tools in the url below, use scene-merge.sh to 
    merge scene_TLs into a single script-japanese-with-translation.txt,
    and Formatter.bat to create a _script-japanese.txt file that needs 
    to be copied into translation\_script-japanese.txt in the Tools repo.

    Then follow instructions in:

    https://github.com/OldCorpo/Xenon-PC98-Tools

    More intermediate tools might be needed.
	Way to go!


==========================
====== LEGACY NOTES ======
==========================

In the translation, I use the following code :

 - When a line starts with '/*', it means I am not satisfied with
 the translation I used and that it needs rephrasing.
 - Some other things are explained at the beginning of src/Formatter.c
 (the source code of the formatter)
 
 The file 'translation-notes.rtf' serves as a notepad for me.
 
 The file 'title_screen_tracy's_melancholy_jap.BMP' shows the title screen of the last ending.
 I don't know how this is stored in the game but, this will have to be translated
 as :
	肉奴隷			Sex slave
	トレイシーの憂鬱	Tracy's melancholy

======

The (mostly complete) scene translations are located in the scene_TLs directory.
They are more or less broken down by scene, but there is some overlap.
Current second pass TL progress: Start of s0106
